# stupiddb

A very simple DB in clojure, it only has 5 commands.

## Usage
;use the namespace
(use 'stupiddb.core)
;; create / init / load a db that saves every 30 seconds
(def db (init-db "my-db-file.db" 30))
;; work with it
(db-assoc db :key :value)
(db-get db :key)
(db-dissoc :key)

;close the db - you don't have to do this if your programm ends here it will just stop the DB from saving
(close-db db)

## Installation

use lein-search :P
